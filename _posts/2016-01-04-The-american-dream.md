title: The American Dream
---

The most important part of the american dream is the idea that anyone who
works hard for long enough, will succeed. These successfull people are seen as
the most important to the 
development of society, and are rewarded for their actions with wealth beyond 
imagination, with this wealth they can do whatever they want, they
are granted true freedom. This helps to incentivies the people who have'nt
succeeded yet to go out and become their dream person.( most people seem to
have the same dream which is very strange to me, perhaps this could be the
subject of another blog entree )

This core principle is great in theory but in practice the unfortunate outcome
is that opertunity is not equal, and because of this its not as simple as the 
people who strive and try the hardest are rewarded with the greatest wealth the
truth is that it's a combination of the people who had the most opertunity ( due
to ancestral wealth or simply which school district you are in ), who tries the
hardest, and who got the most lucky. The best example of the unequal opertunity
of differing classes of people is in the fact that wealth accumulates,
generating families such as the Waltan Family (of wallmart) which over the years
have managed to accumulate 146.7 billion dollars which is equivellent to
either 28 or 41 percent of the total capitol of the united states depending
on whether or not you count families which have a negitive net wealth or not.

The fact that wealth accumulates speaks to the fact that opertutinty is not
equal in the united states, imagine how much harder a child of a minimum wage
employee would have to work to work in order to compete with a member of the 
walton family who simply inherited their wealth. Some would say its not
possible to work hard enough in order to acheive what they were born with.
As much as it is exceedingly difficult its not impossible, you simply need a
tramendis amount of luck.

luck the means by which many people got their obseen amount of wealth, examples
such as ---insert shark dude here---, who managed to create his wealth from
nothing born with not a penny in his pocket his familly migrated to Canada
from Romania, his family struggled to pay rent, now he's a multi-milionare,
his success; however, should not be atributed to his detecation to his family,
nor his pure drive but rather that he got exceedingly luckly, lucky that his 
family got into the contract for the vacume cleaner which nearly bankrupted
him, lucky that he ended up in canada rather than most other places, lucky
that he could afford to leave romania in the first place.
