	The most important part of the American dream is the idea that anyone who works hard enough and long enough, will succeed, and once you succeed you can contribute to society. These successful people are seen as the most important to the development of society, and some are rewarded for their actions with wealth beyond their imagination. Wealth grants you true freedom in America; with it you can control everything from which laws get passed, to what poorer people or you can do for a living. This helps to incentivize some people who haven't succeeded yet to go and contribute to society until they too are granted the freedom they desire. This core principle is great in theory, but in practice the unfortunate outcome is that often people work extremely hard all their lives, and aren't properly rewarded for their efforts or their contributions, or are never given the opportunity to succeed in the first place. 

	The American dream is not real. The ability to contribute is not simply rewarded to the people who work the hardest. Many people are never given the opportunity or the resources to contribute. The truth is that you have to be a person who has the most opportunity, luck, and yes… motivation. Such people contribute the most to society, but it would be impossible for them to contribute without a combination of all three of these things.  

	The best example of the unequal opportunity of differing classes of people is in the fact that wealth accumulates, generating families such as the Walton Family that over the years have managed to latch on to 146.7 billion dollars, 28 to 41 percent of the wealth of all American families combined. The fact that wealth accumulates speaks to the fact that opportunity is not equal in the United States. Imagine how much harder a child of a minimum wage employee would have to work in order to compete with a child of the Walton family who simply inherited their wealth. Some would say it’s not possible to work hard enough in order to achieve what they were born with. As much as it is exceedingly difficult it’s not impossible, you simply need a ton of luck. 
	
	Luck is a major factor in the means by which the people who came from nothing make their wealth, with examples such as Robert Herjavec (The CEO and founder of Herjavec Group, a prominent informational security company). He grew up very poor. Seeking work and political freedom, his family migrated from Croatia to Canada with only 20 dollars and a briefcase; his family struggled to pay rent with his father making only 76 dollars a week at a factory. Being originally a Croatian, he didn’t speak English and he wasn’t in any ESL classes, so he struggled to keep up with his classmates. Robert Herjavec would say that he didn't let this deter him, that he pushed through it, for himself and for his family and that's why he is now a multi-millionaire. His success, however, should not be attributed to his dedication to his family nor his pure drive, but rather to his exceedingly great luck. When asked what the most crucial moment of his development was, he said when his mother got into an unforgiving contract for the vacuum cleaner, the cost of which neared the cost of their rent. This event made him strive to avoid his family ever being put in that situation again. He was lucky in that he developed such a passion for his family; most children wouldn’t react like this. Lucky that even with his extreme motivation, and despite his lack of opportunity, he was able to succeed. He was lucky that he ended up in Canada where education and general resources for the impoverished are world class. Lucky that he could afford to leave Croatia in the first place.

	 The American dream is just that, a dream, and nothing more. The factors that contribute toward the success of individuals are immense: luck, opportunity, and effort should all be seen at least as equal to one another. The America dream for far too many is a nightmare of unequal opportunity, luck, and freedom for the rich.
