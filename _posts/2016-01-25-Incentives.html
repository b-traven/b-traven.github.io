<h1 id=post_title>WIP Incentives</h1>
	All your life you've been rewarded for your achievements. Whether it was your kindergarten teacher giving you a gold star for being good in class or your boss giving you a bonus for your recent achievements, you've been rewarded for doing a good job. This seems to make since, people often enjoy being rewarded for a good job, and it seems like people work better when rewarded more. Your superior, following this logic, likely did this in hopes that it would inspire you to perform in the same if not better in the future. Little did you or your Superior know,  by rewarding you, your superior actually made you want to perform that task less when unrewarded in the future. Why and to what extent is this the case? What are the implications of this?<br><br>

	Studies by Harry Harlon (a professor of psychology University of Wisconsin), and  Edward Deci (a professor of psychology at University of Rochester) began the trend of physiologist studying the idea of motivation, intrinsic, and extrinsic motivation. Harry Harlon's crude study was of primates; he simply put a puzzle in a room with a primate, and what he noticed is that, without any incentive, the primates would solve the puzzle, and then they would try to get faster.  Harry Harlon's next test was to see how the primates would react to an incentive, they were given a raisin if they succeeded, this influenced the performance greatly, oddly, in the negative direction. Edward Deci's studies were a little more complicated. Participants were supposed to make 3 geometric figure according to pictures using smaller geometric figures. Their were two groups a control and a experimental group. The experimental group was given nothing on the 1st and 3rd days but on the 2nd day were told they would get a dollar for each geometric figure they replicated accurately and the control group were told they would be given nothing any day. Deci put the participants in a room with three magazines and the equipment needed to conduct the experiment. What Deci did was as soon as the participants finished the second puzzle he would leave the room and tell the participants they can do what ever they want while he was gone. When he left he went to a one way window, and what he saw was that while on the second day the experimental group was very interested in the puzzle but on the third day they were not, while the control group were nominally interested in the puzzles on all 3 days. The incentive only motivated the individuals when the incentive was still present, once it was gone the individuals completely lost interest. This begs the question when if ever should people be incentivized to do or for doing a task?<br><br>

	Their have been many studies proving that extrinsic motivation is harmful for tasks that require some amount of problem solving; however, the results for tasks that don't involve problem solving differ. Two studies funded by the united states federal reserve say that for tasks that are not mentally involved the typical incentive models does work. These two studies where conducted in complete opposite environments MIT and rural Madurai India. In this study they gave several challenges ranging from simple mechanical work to memorization of numbers and mental puzzles. Depending on there performance they were given a monetary reward.  What these studies concluded was that when the monetary reward increased, performance of tasks that involved mental activity went down. The more interesting thing though was that these studies concluded that incentives do actually work for tasks that don't require any sort of thinking. So it's reasonable to think that incentives should only be used for tasks which don't involve thinking, like physical education, or in doing tedious jobs like being a waiter, or a pizza delivery man, or a post man. It might be that these tasks which don't require any sort of problem solving skills actually don't need to be done at all though.<br><br>

	What tasks that require extrinsic motivation and incentives to conduct actually need to be done by someone other than the person who needs the service done? It seems that most if not all jobs that require no problem solving or skill can be done by the person who needs the service. An example of this would be a waiter, it's very simple to replace a waiter, you can replace them with something as simple as a piece if paper and a menu. All you have to do is have the menu and have the people who want the service write down what they want the chef to make. How about another one, the pizza delivery man, the system is already in place for this one, just go pick up the pizza.  A postman, once again it's fairly simple to just go and pick up your mail at the post office. You might be asking yourself now, what about the people who can't get their mail or go to their local pizza place. On this I would argue that many people are intrinsically motivated to help people, so these people would also have their needs met.<br><br>

	The facts make it clear incentives are not needed and are often in fact harmful to inspiring people to do intellectual work. When incentives are needed to make some one do a task it often doesn't involve any thinking and the task its' self is not necessary to the progression of society, so there is never a reason to use incentives. <br><br>
